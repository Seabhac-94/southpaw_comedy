# SouthPaw Comedy Ireland

Cork, Dublin & Limerick are homes of comedy in Ireland, 
and have been for many years. 
The goal of SouthPaw Comedy Ireland is to create a platform 
in which travelling comedy lovers can see where the closest club
to them is in each city.

## UX

Comedy is for everyone, and is bold and loud. For the UX design on this
website, this is what will be achieved, a bold, loud website where users can easily navigate through the 
counties and comedy clubs in the area.

## Features

The following features have been implemented already:

#### Existing Features

1. Incorporated into the site will be google maps, which will have manual place markers
in each of the three counties for the top comedy clubs there. This idea stems from
the idea that SouthPaw Comedy Ireland has hand-picked and recommends these particular comedy clubs, instead 
of a generic "comedy clubs" search engine.

2. Next to the maps will be a select county feature. Originally it was thought to
be a "form group" type, but on further devolpment of the site, it was decided to utilise
button features, with each of the buttons colored the same as the county it represents.

3. Following the button selection, JavaScript has been utilised to slideDown and
display key information on each of the comedy clubs in that area.

#### Possible Future Features 

1. Directions: in the future it is planned to link google maps directions ability to
the site, to give users a clear indication of how close the clubs are to them.

2. Restaurants: There is plans to also incorporate a feature that will allow users
to see which restaurants are closest to each club, based on budget and ratings.

## Technologies Used

1. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> was the basic frameworks off which the site was built. Bootstrap was chosen as it provides a simple yet effective frameworks off of which sites can be built.
2. Google Maps API was used to implement the map feature as it provided the data needed to build a successful site which utilises a map function.
3. jQuery was used to implement the
interactive features of the project to simplify manipulation of the DOM and as it provides a good libary of effects for UX.
